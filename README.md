# Stock Price Embedding Model

## Introduction
The Stock Price Embedding Model is a Python project designed to embed historical stock price data into a vector space. This model aims to facilitate various applications, including machine learning, data analysis, and financial forecasting. By transforming stock price data into embeddings, users can leverage advanced algorithms to uncover patterns and insights that traditional data representations may not reveal.

## Setup Instructions
To get started with the Stock Price Embedding Model, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashutoshDhopte/stock-price-embedding-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-price-embedding-model
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guide
After setting up the project, you can use the model to embed stock price data. Here's a quick example:

```python
from stock_price_embedding import StockPriceEmbedder

# Initialize the embedder
embedder = StockPriceEmbedder()

# Load your stock price data (in CSV format)
data = embedder.load_data('path/to/your/stock_data.csv')

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = embedder.embed(data)

# Visualize or analyze the embeddings as needed
```
